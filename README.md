# VBA_Challenge
## Overview_of_The project
The project involved analysing wall stret data of stocks so as to determine which ones were doing good to invest.
## Results
The analysis required recording the exection time of the code and nalaysing stocks for two years: 2017 and 2018.
### Code performance for 2017 code

#### Code comaprison (Refractored vs Original)
##### 2017 Code original execution time

In both instances the refractored code was faster
## Summary
In summary a refractored code runs faster.
### Pros
*Reduces run time hence increasing efficiency
*Reduces code smell through assertion introduction, class extraction, method renaming etc.
*Ensures easy to understand code
*Saves resources
### Cons
*You can potentially introduce bugs that your tests won't catch. Remember that any time you make a change, there is a potential to introduce a bug.
